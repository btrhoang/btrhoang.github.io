                    <p>Whenever my triumphant steps pass a reflective surface, my course changes as every possible angle is now brutally reflected. I used to dread my plump silhouette.</p>
<p>From a young age, I was accustomed to being called chubby. My relatives would never stop reprimanding me for being overweight, and my classmates who were jealous of my academic achievements told me my size would prevent me from ever being successful.</p>
<p>These remarks only served to make me study harder to shift their attention from my appearance to my accomplishments. Whenever I saw my reflection, I would go into self-denial: I was not at all chubby!</p>
<p>However, deep down, I knew the truth. In fact, I turned down an invitation from a boy whom I adored since I didn’t feel worthy because of my physical appearance.</p>
<p>This was my turning point.</p>
<p>I secretly embarked on a weight loss journey by following a Korean idol’s diet on the Internet that promised to help me lose ten kilograms every week. The daily meal plan consisted of two eggs, two slices of bread, and a banana. I almost fainted twice. That was when I seriously began to watch health-focused videos featuring nutritionists to build a scientifically-proven and long-term weight loss plan.</p>
<p>For the first few months, I tried every imaginable 30-minute cardio exercise on YouTube. Initially, it felt like my heart would give out. I recall trying to trick my brain: &ldquo;Only 40 seconds left, just like brushing my teeth!&rdquo; I consumed exactly 1,200 calories every day and bought a kitchen scale to track my intake. I opted for more wholesome, low-calorie food, such as sweet potatoes, fish, shrimp, and tropical fruits.</p>
<p>After the first month, I lost two kilograms. Although I was still chubby, I started to truly appreciate my body. My newfound self-esteem led me to enroll in my school’s solo singing contest, wear fashionable, form-fitting clothes to MUN conferences, and confidently strike up a conversation with that boy who had expressed interest.</p>
<p>My efforts inspired  family and friends. I then suggested that they begin by simply lowering their sugar intake and walking a minimum of 5,000 steps a day. Witnessing their progress, I was so motivated to help others that my Facebook science-themed page, Scientiador, featured a series on nutrition. After recruiting a team of like-minded thirty high school students, I offered tips about counting calories, reading food labels, and the harmful consequences of consuming too much sugar. We then collaborated with local fitness influencers to conduct workshops to teach participants how to make healthy smoothies. I now have a community of 4,000 followers!</p>
<p>I have managed to shed 15 kilograms by making wise food choices. I now know that striving for a healthy lifestyle is an endeavor of a lifetime. In fact, my insight has influenced my career decision and given me my life’s mission. I recently added one more goal to my vision board: after earning my credentials, I will launch a foundation to help overweight Vietnamese teenagers overcome their body insecurity.</p>
<p>P/S: These pictures marked the time when I was the most chubby.</p>
